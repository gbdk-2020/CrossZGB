# Tile streaming example

This example shows how to load the sprite tile data to animate the player sprite instead of using the native CrossZGB sprite animation feature.

It also shows, how you may use the `MakefileCustom` file to add rules for converting and compiling the custom assets (files in the ./res/metatiles/ in this example) using your own custom tools (located in the ./tools/png2metatiles.py).
