# Pacman example
This example implements the base logic for the famous arcade game. It contain only CGB and GG art, thus compiles only for those two targets.

It demonstrates:
- the use of coroutine engine for the game logic (player and enemies)
- updatable level tilemaps with lots of collectable items
- Lee path finding algorithm

It is still missing:
- Music and SFX
- HUD, lives counter
- "Victory" and "gave over" screens
- "Hall of fame" - save high score values
- Different logic for the enemies
- Probably, something else...
